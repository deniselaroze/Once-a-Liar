# Why-we-Cheat-2016
Data and R Replication Code for Duch Solaz
We conduct tax compliance experiments in which subjects earn real money, are subject to a tax, and can lie about their earnings. 
Performing better on incentivized real effort tasks results in more cheating.  Cheating rises as the tax rate increases; but the higher 
levels of cheating by those who excelled at the tasks persists in high and low tax treatments.  This correlation persists when earnings 
are associated with luck; the correlation persists in experimental treatments with more redistributive taxation.  The correlation persists
for choices made in other games by the same subjects : High performance types give less in a conventional Dictator Game and also cheat
more in a classic die game in which they privately report the results of tossing a die.
